 * Feature: Payments
 * Description: Retreives a list of all the Money Pools for a 
 *              specific event. The reason for the Money Pool, 
 *              how much in total is required(goal) for that Pool
 *              and how much has been paid so far are returned.
 *  
 *              Note: Initially I was going to make it so it was
 *              individual payments, as in each user would pay 
 *              individual fees, but decided that a larger Money Pool
 *              would be better suited.
